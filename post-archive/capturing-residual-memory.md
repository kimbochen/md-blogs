## Motivation

Back in 2019 when travelling is not impossible, during my tour in the Canadian 
Rockies, it occured to me that this might be my first time _and_ last time to 
see these spectacular scenery. There was nothing left but a vague impression of 
the experience. I felt that so much was lost and forgotten as time passed by.  
Fortunately, I took pictures with my smartphone. Despite being a crude 
representation of my experience, it captured a certain amount of reality and 
most importantly, _it lasts_. Those pictures captured the remainings of my 
memory and could remind me of the experiences whenever I saw the pictures.  
Inspired by Jeremy Howard, I hope my blog could also capture my learning 
journey the way a smartphone captures a beautiful landscape. Besides, I wish 
by documenting my learning journey, I could help someone who struggled with 
the same problem as I did.

## Expectation

I plan to write about every project that is worth documenting. Other than 
that, I might write something about K-pop or anything hobby-related. I hope I 
could post regularly, ideally every week.

## Conclusion

This blog is an attempt of me trying to capture and share what I have learned.
